<h2> My favorite Sites: </h2>
<ul><a href="https://www.happycow.net/" target="_blank">Happy Cow</a><p> Provides Vegetarian and Vegan Restaurants in the area.
     This site was a big help for me when I was a vegan and trying to find a good place to eat in the city or while visiting new areas.</p>
</ul>
<ul><a href="https://voiranime.com/" target="_blank">Voir Anime</a><p> This site is for Anime shows and movies. It is often hard to find a good
    source for anime that has the original anime and I use this site from time to time.
</p>
</ul>
<ul><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank">Geeks4Geeks</a><p> This site has been very resourceful for me while studying computer science.
    I use it pretty much every semester. This is a popular site like Stack Overflow or W3W Schools.
